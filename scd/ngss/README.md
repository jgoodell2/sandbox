**Crosscutting Concepts, Practices, Core Ideas, and Connections**

*Crosscutting Concepts*

1. Patterns

High School (9-12)
* Different patterns may be observed at each of the scales at which a system is studied and can provide evidence for causality in explanations of phenomena.
* Empirical evidence is needed to identify patterns.
* Classifications or explanations used at one scale may fail or need revision when information from smaller or larger scales is introduced; thus requiring improved investigations and experiments.
* Patterns of performance of designed systems can be analyzed and interpreted to reengineer and improve the system.
* Mathematical representations are needed to identify some patterns.
2. Cause and Effect
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Empirical evidence is required to differentiate between cause and correlation and make claims about specific causes and effects.
 Systems can be designed to cause a desired effect.
 Cause and effect relationships can be suggested and predicted for complex natural and human designed systems by examining what is known about smaller scale mechanisms within the system.
 Changes in systems may have various causes that may not have equal effects.
3. Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 The significance of a phenomenon is dependent on the scale, proportion, and quantity at which it occurs.
 Algebraic thinking is used to examine scientific data and predict the effect of a change in one variable on another (e.g., linear growth vs. exponential growth).
 Using the concept of orders of magnitude allows one to understand how a model at one scale relates to a model at another scale.
 Some systems can only be studied indirectly as they are too small, too large, too fast, or too slow to observe directly.
 Patterns observable at one scale may not be observable or exist at other scales.
4. Systems and System Models
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 When investigating or describing a system, the boundaries and initial conditions of the system need to be defined and their inputs and outputs analyzed and described using models.
 Models (e.g., physical, mathematical, computer models) can be used to simulate systems and interactions—including energy, matter, and information flows—within and between systems at different scales.
 Models can be used to predict the behavior of a system, but these predictions have limited precision and reliability due to the assumptions and approximations inherent in models.
 Systems can be designed to do specific tasks.
5. Energy and Matter
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 In nuclear processes, atoms are not conserved, but the total number of protons plus neutrons is conserved.
 The total amount of energy and matter in closed systems is conserved.
 Changes of energy and matter in a system can be described in terms of energy and matter flows into, out of, and within that system.
 Energy cannot be created or destroyed—it only moves between one place and another place, between objects and/or fields, or between systems.
 Energy drives the cycling of matter within and between systems.
6. Structure and Function
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Investigating or designing new systems or structures requires a detailed examination of the properties of different materials, the structures of different components, and connections of components to reveal its function and/or solve a problem.
 The functions and properties of natural and designed objects and systems can be inferred from their overall structure, the way their components are shaped and used, and the molecular substructures of its various materials.

Disciplinary Core Ideas
PS Physical Science
PS1 Matter and Its Interactions
PS1.A Structure and Properties of Matter
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Each atom has a charged substructure consisting of a nucleus, which is made of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.
 The periodic table orders elements horizontally by the number of protons in the atom’s nucleus and places those with similar chemical properties in columns. The repeating patterns of this table reflect patterns of outer electron states.
 The structure and interactions of matter at the bulk scale are determined by electrical forces within and between atoms.
 Stable forms of matter are those in which the electric and magnetic field energy is minimized. A stable molecule has less energy than the same set of atoms separated; one must provide at least this energy in order to take the molecule apart.
PS1.B Chemical Reactions
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Chemical processes, their rates, and whether or not energy is stored or released can be understood in terms of the collisions of molecules and the rearrangements of atoms into new molecules, with consequent changes in the sum of all bond energies in the set of molecules that are matched by changes in kinetic energy.
 In many situations, a dynamic and condition-dependent balance between a reaction and the reverse reaction determines the numbers of all types of molecules present.
 The fact that atoms are conserved, together with knowledge of the chemical properties of the elements involved, can be used to describe and predict chemical reactions.
PS1.C Nuclear Processes
High School (9-12)
 Nuclear processes, including fusion, fission, and radioactive decays of unstable nuclei, involve release or absorption of energy. The total number of neutrons plus protons does not change in any nuclear process.
 Spontaneous radioactive decays follow a characteristic exponential decay law. Nuclear lifetimes allow radiometric dating to be used to determine the ages of rocks and other materials.
PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions
PS2.A Forces and Motion
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Newton’s second law accurately predicts changes in the motion of macroscopic objects.
 Momentum is defined for a particular frame of reference; it is the mass times the velocity of the object. In any system, total momentum is always conserved.
 If a system interacts with objects outside itself, the total momentum of the system can change; however, any such change is balanced by changes in the momentum of objects outside the system.
PS2.B Types of Interactions
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Coulomb’s law provide the mathematical models to describe and predict the effects of gravitational and electrostatic forces between distant objects.
 Forces at a distance are explained by fields (gravitational, electric, and magnetic) permeating space that can transfer energy through space. Magnets or electric currents cause magnetic fields; electric charges or changing magnetic fields cause electric fields.
 Attraction and repulsion between electric charges at the atomic scale explain the structure, properties, and transformations of matter, as well as the contact forces between material objects.
 PS2.C Stability and Instability in Physical Systems
PS3 Energy
PS3.A Definitions of Energy
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Energy is a quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system. That there is a single quantity called energy is due to the fact that a system’s total energy is conserved, even as, within the system, energy is continually transferred from one object to another and between its various possible forms.
 At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways, such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy.
 These relationships are better understood at the microscopic scale, at which all of the different manifestations of energy can be modeled as a combination of energy associated with the motion of particles and energy associated with the configuration (relative position of the particles). In some cases the relative position energy can be thought of as stored in fields (which mediate interactions between particles). This last concept includes radiation, a phenomenon in which energy stored in fields moves across space.
 “Electrical energy” may mean energy stored in a battery or energy transmitted by electric currents.
PS3.B Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Conservation of energy means that the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system.
 Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transported from one place to another and transferred between systems.
 Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on its configuration (e.g. relative positions of charged particles, compression of a spring) and how kinetic energy depends on mass and speed, allow the concept of conservation of energy to be used to predict and describe system behavior.
 The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system.
 Uncontrolled systems always evolve toward more stable states—that is, toward more uniform energy distribution (e.g., water flows downhill, objects hotter than their surrounding environment cool down).
PS3.C Relationship Between Energy and Forces
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 When two objects interacting through a field change relative position, the energy stored in the field is changed.
PS3.D Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Although energy cannot be destroyed, it can be converted to less useful forms—for example, to thermal energy in the surrounding environment.
 Solar cells are human-made devices that likewise capture the sun’s energy and produce electrical energy.
 The main way that solar energy is captured and stored on Earth is through the complex chemical process known as photosynthesis.
 Nuclear Fusion processes in the center of the sun release the energy that ultimately reaches Earth as radiation.
PS4 Waves and Their Applications in Technologies for Information Transfer
PS4.A Wave Properties
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 The wavelength and frequency of a wave are related to one another by the speed of travel of the wave, which depends on the type of wave and the medium through which it is passing.
 Information can be digitized (e.g., a picture stored as the values of an array of pixels); in this form, it can be stored reliably in computer memory and sent over long distances as a series of wave pulses.
 Waves can add or cancel one another as they cross, depending on their relative phase (i.e., relative position of peaks and troughs of the waves), but they emerge unaffected by each other. (Boundary: The discussion at this grade level is qualitative only; it can be based on the fact that two different sounds can pass a location in different directions without getting mixed up.)
 Geologists use seismic waves and their reflection at interfaces between layers to probe structures deep in the planet.
PS4.B Electromagnetic Radiation
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Electromagnetic radiation (e.g., radio, microwaves, light) can be modeled as a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles called photons. The wave model is useful for explaining many features of electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model explains other features.
 When light or longer wavelength electromagnetic radiation is absorbed in matter, it is generally converted into thermal energy (heat). Shorter wavelength electromagnetic radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays) can ionize atoms and cause damage to living cells.
 Photoelectric materials emit electrons when they absorb light of a high-enough frequency.
 Atoms of each element emit and absorb characteristic frequencies of light. These characteristics allow identification of the presence of an element, even in microscopic quantities.
PS4.C Information Technologies and Instrumentation
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Multiple technologies based on the understanding of waves and their interactions with matter are part of everyday experiences in the modern world (e.g., medical imaging, communications, scanners) and in scientific research. They are essential tools for producing, transmitting, and capturing signals and for storing and interpreting the information contained in them.

 New technologies advance scientific knowledge.
 Scientific inquiry is characterized by a common set of values that include: logical thinking, precision, open-mindedness, objectivity, skepticism, replicability of results, and honest and ethical reporting of findings.
 The discourse practices of science are organized around disciplinary domains that share exemplars for making decisions regarding the values, instruments, methods, models, and evidence to adopt and use.

 Scientific explanations can be probabilistic.
 Most scientific knowledge is quite durable, but is, in principle, subject to change based on new evidence and/or reinterpretation of existing evidence.
 Scientific argumentation is a mode of logical discourse used to clarify the strength of relationships between ideas and evidence that may result in revision of an explanation.
Practices - Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain Natural Phenomena
Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Theories and laws provide explanations in science, but theories do not with time become laws or facts.
 A scientific theory is a substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment and the science community validates each theory before it is accepted. If new evidence is discovered that the theory does not accommodate, the theory is generally modified in light of this new evidence.
 Models, mechanisms, and explanations collectively serve as tools in the development of a scientific theory.
 Laws are statements or descriptions of the relationships among observable phenomena.
 Scientists often use hypotheses to develop and test theories and explanations.
Crosscutting Concepts - Science is a Way of Knowing
Primary School (K-2)

Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Science is both a body of knowledge that represents a current understanding of natural systems and the processes used to refine, elaborate, revise, and extend this knowledge.
 Science is a unique way of knowing and there are other ways of knowing.
 Science distinguishes itself from other ways of knowing through use of empirical standards, logical arguments, and skeptical review.
 Science knowledge has a history that includes the refinement of, and changes to, theories, ideas, and beliefs over time.
Crosscutting Concepts - Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order and Consistency in Natural Systems

Primary School (K-2)
Elementary School (3-5)
Middle School (6-8)
High School (9-12)
 Not all questions can be answered by science.
 Science and technology may raise ethical issues for which science, by itself, does not provide answers and solutions.
 Science knowledge indicates what can happen in natural systems—not what should happen. The latter involves ethics, values, and human decisions about the use of knowledge.
 Many decisions are not made using science alone, but rely on social and cultural contexts to resolve issues.
